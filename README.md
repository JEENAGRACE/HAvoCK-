## How it works

An HTML file was created to  set up the basic structure which contains the buttons with different emotions .
The user can choose any emotion based on their mood by clicking and it redirects to the next  page .
This page contains  random quotes based on the chosen emotion , which on clicking a button “Wanna see moree??” changes to a new one .
This is implemented by creating  a JavaScript file for the application logic .Here we declare an array to store your quotes. Using a  function that, when triggered by the button “Wanna see moree??”, selects a random quote from the array and updates the content in the HTML.
Each button performs the above mentioned function.
